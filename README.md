# About this project 

This is a project I carried out as a part of Google Data Analytics course to practice Tableau and SQL skills and apply them to real-world data analytic problem. 

Project consists of 2 Readme.md files: 

One of them outlines detailed step-by-step technical process I followed to tackle the problem. It includes code I used as well as reasoning behind every action I undertook as part of data manipulation, processing and analysis. 

Second one focuses on presenting the findings of the analysis. It does not containt technical, behind-the-scenes information, but heavily employs data vizualizations to communicate the findings. It is constructed in a form of business presentation. 

Hope you can find this helpful and demonstrative of my skills and analytical thinking abilities.
